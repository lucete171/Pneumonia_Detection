# Pneumonia_Detection
We intend to develop a program to determine pneumonia through a deep learning (CNN) model by inputting a chest x-ray image.

The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.
